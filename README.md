SparkFun Simblee Breakout Board
==================

The [SparkFun Simblee Breakout Board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13632) is a programmable board that allows you to add mobile app functionality via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE, or Bluetooth 4.0) to your embedded projects. Unlike other BLE solutions, the Simblee requires no specialized app development skills to realize the phone-side interface; all the necessary coding is done in the Arduino environment and then uploaded to a browser app on the phone.
